# Introduction
WaterDo is a todo list app with gamification feature, making daily tasks fun. In this app, users schedule their personal tasks as bubbles, popping them when they completed and gaining energy. With energy gain from bubbles, users could explore stories in WaterDo. I participated the project from scratch as a Unity programmer, worked in a cross-functional team with professional people.
