    description: `Escape The Room is the first game I have ever created. 
        This type of game was popular when I was a child. 
        The playerâ€™s goal is to escape an enclosed room by solving puzzles. 
        When I built this game, I knew very little about programming, and it was hard to develop at first. 
        But I gradually found that programming is an enjoyable activity. 
        For me, solving programming problems is like solving puzzles in a game. 
        I also designed puzzles and drew art materials by myself. 
        These experiences gave me plenty of enjoyment.`,

          This is a game for Weekly Game Jam 249 and the subject is Mysterious
          Fruit. It was made in 6 days including game design, art, and
          programming. We are inspired by Rusty Lake which is a well-known
          puzzle game. We made all this from scratch from the first day of the
          game jam without pre-developed tools and discussions.

          In addition, I wrote a devlog for this project and a demo project for
          the core system in this game.
