        This type of game was popular when I was a child. 
        The playerâ€™s goal is to escape an enclosed room by solving puzzles. 
        When I built this game, I knew very little about programming, and it was hard to develop at first. 
        But I gradually found that programming is an enjoyable activity. 
        For me, solving programming problems is like solving puzzles in a game. 
        I also designed puzzles and drew art materials by myself. 
        These experiences gave me plenty of enjoyment.`,

          TeruTeruBeru is a game developed by a team of three people, consisting
          of two programmers and one 2D artist. The game was created for AardJam
          on Itch.io using Unity and was completed within three days. Despite
          the short development time, we very enjoyed it. The game&apos;s code
          is also well-structured, which makes it easy to work with and modify
          in the future.

        <Paragraph>
          The objective of the game is to build a tower as high as possible. The
          tower grows taller each day, and the weather changes daily. Villagers
          spawn during sunny days, and players must keep them alive. If a player
          loses all villagers, they lose the game. During the night, villagers
          will predict the weather for the next day, and players must decide
          whether to ring the bell for the following day. Ringing the bell means
          instructing villagers to work on the tower. However, if the weather is
          bad, at least one villager will die. Villagers spawn during the day,
          build the tower during midday, and predict the weather during the
          night.
