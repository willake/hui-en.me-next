This is the source code of my personal website
## Getting Started

First, intall the modules. I use pnpm for the example:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Next, you can run it in development mode:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The website is deployed to vercel. To doing so, you can run this code:
```bash
vercel --prod
```
