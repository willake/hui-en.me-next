    description: `Escape The Room is the first game I have ever created. 
        This type of game was popular when I was a child. 
        The playerâ€™s goal is to escape an enclosed room by solving puzzles. 
        When I built this game, I knew very little about programming, and it was hard to develop at first. 
        But I gradually found that programming is an enjoyable activity. 
        For me, solving programming problems is like solving puzzles in a game. 
        I also designed puzzles and drew art materials by myself. 
        These experiences gave me plenty of enjoyment.`,
