                    Snowball Rage is a game that a friend and I created for the 2018 Unreal Game Jam. At the Game Jam, 
                    developers have a week to create a game. I primarily used Blueprint to implement game functions. 
                    The idea was to allow players to experience the thrill of destruction. 
                    The gameâ€™s min character is a snowball that keeps rolling toward a village at the foot of a mountain. 
                    It keeps growing as it rolls down. It can destroy obstacles and roll over villagers to gain points on the way down. 
                    If a villager hits the snowball, it shrinks. 
                    The player must ensure the snowball is of a specific size when it reaches the village to destroy it.
